## About

The purpose of the OWIN-D specification is to provide an abstraction from any IoT (Internet of Things) or Web Services for Devices protocol.

OWIN-D defines a standard framework for REST device servers written for io.js, Node.js and application/device logic. It works with any protocol such as COAP, WSDP, OIC iotivity, HomeKit, and can be a drop-in replacement for existing frameworks such as Connect/Express to re-use existing code.

OWIN-D is a superset of the OWIN-JS specifications for HTTP and COAP servers, supporting Node.JS enterprise-grade servers, browser-apps, and constained device implementations.

The goal of OWIN-D is to decouple transport and device logic and, by being an open standard, stimulate the open source ecosystem of Node.js web application/device development tools, without ties to any one framework or device protocol.

OWIN-D expands the REST philosophy to web servers, internet of things, etc.

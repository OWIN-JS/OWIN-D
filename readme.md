## About

OWIN-D provides an abstraction from any IoT (Internet of Things) or Device protocol.  In particular, OWIN-D defines a standard framework for REST device containers that can be used with any  particular protocol (e.g., HomeKit, iotivity) or transport (e.g., HTTP, CoAP), and enables a simple abstraction to simplify development.

OWIN-D is itself standards based, as an extension of the OWIN-JS specification, but specifically targeted for Internet of Things manufacturers and application developers.

The goal of OWIN-D is to decouple transport and device logic and, by being a free open-source standard (under Creative Commons), stimulate the open source ecosystem of IoT device development tools, without ties to any one framework or device protocols, while at the same time being used in commercial applications without restriction.

## Specification
[OWIN-D Specification](./Specification.md)  (this repository)

We recommend reviewing the [OWIN-JS Specification](http://owinjs.org) and [limerun framework](http://limerun.com) in conjunction with this OWIN-D specification.
